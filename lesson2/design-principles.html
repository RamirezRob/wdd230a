            <h5>Fullstory</h5>
            <h5><a href="https://www.fullstory.com/">www.fullstory.com</a></h5>
            <img src="/lesson2/images/FullstoryScreenshot.png" alt="">
            <p>Using one bright color as a focal point can help
                draw attention, no matter where you place that
                element in the order of your design.
                In the example below, as well as with most website
                navigation, you will notice a primary high contrasting
                color on buttons that serve as the most crucial call to
                actions. By helping users understand where you want them
                to go, you can give them a more pleasant experience and
                increase conversions in your desired flow.

            <h4>Hicks Law</h4>
            <h5>The Hustle</h5>
            <h5><a href="https://thehustle.co/">thehustle.co</a></h5>
            <img src="/lesson2/images/TheHustleScreenshot.png" alt="" >
            <p>Because your homepage sets the tone for the rest of your user's
                interactions with your website or app, it's especially crucial
                you build it with Hick's Law in mind. If the first thing they
                experience is a cluttered homepage with disorganized modules,
                an overabundance of images, and slow-loading images, it's off-putting.
                The Hustle's homepage is a great example of Hick's Law in action.

            <h4>White space in design</h4>
            <h5>Tubik UX</h5>
            <h5><a href="https://dribbble.com/tubik_ux">dribbble.com/tubik_ux</a></h5>
            <img src="/lesson2/images/TubikScreenshot.png" alt="" >
            <p>White spaces are used to separate elements and to help us identify
                the visiting areas. Without spaces, it is difficult to read,
                understand, and identify distinct elements from another. Thus,
                it’ll be difficult for the design to be interpreted. In short,
                white spaces are important for a design to make sense.
